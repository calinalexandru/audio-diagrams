# Audio Diagrams

Audio Diagrams is an interactive tool designed to simplify the process of experimenting with and understanding the modern Web Audio API. Users can effortlessly create audio routing graphs using intuitive drag & drop operations. Each draggable component on the interface represents an audio-processing module, closely mimicking the functionalities detailed in the [Web Audio API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

## Features
- **Modular Audio Routing**: Just as the Web Audio API allows modular routing, this tool offers a visual platform for users to interlink various audio nodes, crafting a comprehensive audio routing graph.

- **Diverse Node Support**: Work with a variety of audio nodes including Oscillator, Gain, Delay, Panner, Analyser, and even the Microphone. Dive deep into the capabilities and characteristics of each node.

- **Advanced Value Adjustments**: Each node is not just a static entity. It supports advanced value manipulations like setValueCurveAtTime, allowing for dynamic sound processing and experimentation.

- **Educational Purpose**: Perfect for both novices and experts alike. For beginners, it's a gateway to understand the Web Audio API in a hands-on manner. For experts, it serves as an isolated environment to identify potential limitations or to pinpoint the significance of specific nodes and filters in achieving exceptional audio quality.

## Motivation
While the Web Audio API offers a broad spectrum of possibilities for audio on the web, real-world usage can sometimes hit unexpected limitations, especially across different browsers and devices. Audio Diagrams emerged from a need to have a straightforward tool to test and explore these limitations. It serves as a sandbox to validate the compatibility and performance of audio nodes and operations, especially when considering cross-browser disparities. If you've ever wondered how a specific audio function behaves on a different browser or wished to benchmark the performance of an audio routine, Audio Diagrams is your go-to utility.


## How to Use
1. **Visit** the [Audio Diagrams interface](https://calinalexandru.github.io/audio-diagrams/).
2. **Drag & Drop** nodes from the selection onto the canvas.
3. **Link nodes** together to form an audio routing graph.
4. **Play** around with advanced values and observe the effects in real-time.
5. **Learn & Innovate!**

## Contribute
Audio Diagrams is open-source and thrives on contributions from the community. Whether it's a bug fix, feature suggestion, or even a tutorial on how to use a particular node, your contributions are always welcome.
