Create audio routing graphs using drag &amp; drop operations. Each component represents an audio-processing module as described here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode

## [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)

> The Web Audio API involves handling audio operations inside an audio context, and has been designed to allow modular routing. Basic audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form an audio routing graph. Several sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.
